- add animation for candle
- add light and bloom + dof
- add barrier when compute and graphic queue is not the same 
- more *physic-based* realistic vortex snow-fall
- need a camera movement
- hot reload with that file watcher library
- shader reflection
- fix that Vulkan instance extensions layers
- Other feature:
    - Separate images and sampler descriptors
    - Multi-threaded command buffer generation
    - Multiple subpasses
    - Compute shaders
        - Asynchronous compute
        - Atomic operations
        - Subgroups
    - Multiple target rendering?
